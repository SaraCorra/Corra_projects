# Quantifying the Effect of Beta Blockers on Mortality: A Bayesian Hierarchical Meta-Analysis

The research aims at applying Bayesian Hierarchical methodology for meta-analysis of 13 studies on short-term mortality in patients admitted to coronary units after myocardial infarctions, and treated with intravenious beta-blockers.

Repository for final project in Bayesian Modelling course for Data Analytics for Business MSc course in Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan, Italy). Project completed by Corrà Sara and Shaboian Goar.

In the context of the project, reference is made to the following scientific paper: Yusuf, S., Peto, R., Lewis, J., Collins, R., & Sleight, P. (1985). Beta blockade during and after myocardial infarction: An overview of the randomized trials. Progress in Cardiovascular Disease,
